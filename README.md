## Installation
First, clone the starter code from this repository. 


From the root directory, run npm install in the command line.

## Usage
Open the terminal in the Develop folder. Type "node index.js" in the command line and you will be asked a series of questions about your project. Adding a license is optional, and you can select from the three most common open source licenses. After the last question is answered, a file called README.md will be created in the dist folder including all the information you entered, professionally formatted.
